# 👋 Hello, I'm Michael

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a full stack developer focused on building modular, diagnostics-first, event sourcing and maintainable platforms. 
My work centers on modular applications, profile-aware configuration, and secure orchestration—always designed with clarity and future maintainers in mind.

## 🧭 What Guides Me

I believe architecture should empower. Whether building platforms in diffrent languages (C#/Java) or designing audit-friendly CQRS flows, I strive for transparency, traceability, and composability. Every artifact is an opportunity to make onboarding easier and diagnostics sharper.

## 🔍 Quick Snapshot

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a modular Spring Boot (Java 21+) platform, retrofitting entities for audit trails, and building async-ready orchestration layers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced temporal filtering strategies, edge-device diagnostics, and Raspberry Pi orchestration.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on diagnostics-first platforms, secure REST APIs, and event-driven systems with auditability.
- 💬 Ask me about CQRS, Spring Boot diagnostics, async service orchestration, or cross-language maintainability.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m an avid archer—precision and patience in the field mirror how I approach architecture. I also love tinkering with Raspberry Pi setups to explore lightweight orchestration and edge diagnostics.
